# GeneratingAndSortingArray
Find the maximum and minimum elements and their indices in the X (N) array of real numbers. If the index of the maximum element is greater than the index of the 
minimum, then sort the array in ascending order, otherwise - in descending order. Generate array X using a random number generator (N <= 100)
